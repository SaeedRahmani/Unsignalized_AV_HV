This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)

my_comparisons <- list( c("HV-HV", "AV-HV"), c("HV-HV", "HV-AV"))

cross_pet <- read.csv("./pet.csv") %>%
  filter(Conflict.type == "Cross") %>%
  mutate(Vehicle.order = factor(Vehicle.order, levels = c("HV-HV", "AV-HV", "HV-AV")))

box <- ggboxplot(cross_pet, x = "Vehicle.order", y = "PET", colour = "Vehicle.order", palette = "npg", add = "jitter")
box + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons) + stat_compare_means()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
